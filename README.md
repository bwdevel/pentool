A transcoder project that I started in PHP that I update from time-to-time.

Because of the general nature of the tool as a transcoder and the fact
that is VERY alpha, do NOT install on an unfiltered server. Restrict IP
access to trusted IP's only.

There is a LOT of XSS and possible server-side execution vulns here (this is
a very alpha tool, with no intent of release but for personal use.)
